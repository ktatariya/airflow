Overview
This repository showcases an advanced data engineering pipeline that integrates AWS S3, Snowflake, and Apache Airflow (locally hosted through Astronomer) to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable pipeline. Designed for batch processing, this pipeline efficiently handles data ingestion, transformation, and reporting while adhering to best practices in data governance and security.



Features
Data Lake and Data Warehouse Integration: Utilizes AWS S3 for raw and staging data storage and Snowflake for data warehousing with a structured architecture that includes raw, meta, staging, and reporting schemas.

Open Source Orchestration: Apache Airflow manages the pipeline’s tasks and schedules, ensuring workflow orchestration through a modular, parameterized DAG.

Data Governance and Modeling: Strong governance implemented using Snowflake's role-based access control (RBAC) and schemas to standardize data management. Data modeling is applied at various stages, including the creation of a well-structured reporting layer in Snowflake.

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Developed an ERD to plan relationships between tables, ensuring data is normalized and structured in line with best practices.

Parameterized and Dynamic: Uses variables and parameters to avoid hardcoding, promoting reusability and maintainability. The architecture can easily adapt to new datasets, making it suitable for various industries.

Security and Access Control: Implements AWS IAM for user management and Snowflake RBAC to ensure granular access control. Specific roles are created for different levels of access, improving data governance.

Flexible and Scalable: Designed to handle large datasets, this pipeline can scale to support various data volumes and use cases, such as reporting, analytics, and machine learning pipelines.

Time Travel and Historical Data Management: Snowflake’s time-travel functionality is used for historical data management, allowing recovery or auditing of data changes.

Reporting Layer: A reporting data layer is built from raw and staged datasets in Snowflake, providing clean and standardized data ready for analytics.



Architecture
AWS S3: Raw and staging data storage, designed with the potential to scale for different batch intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly).

Snowflake: Acts as the data warehouse, with organized schemas (raw, meta, staging, and reporting) supporting data governance, time-travel, and historical data handling.

Apache Airflow: The pipeline is orchestrated through a DAG, responsible for data ingestion, transformation, and reporting, all while handling failures, retries, and parallelism.



Pipeline Structure
Raw Data Storage: Data is ingested into S3 from multiple sources in its raw form.

Staging Layer: Data is cleaned and transformed into a standardized format within the S3 staging layer. This ensures interoperability across datasets and minimizes redundancy.

Data Warehouse: Data is loaded into Snowflake, where it is structured into raw, meta, staging, and reporting schemas, ensuring adherence to data governance best practices.

Reporting Layer: A reporting view is generated in Snowflake, leveraging optimized queries and well-modeled data to support analytics.



Dataset
This pipeline uses the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist, available on Kaggle, to simulate real-world e-commerce operations. The dataset includes customer orders, products, sellers, and reviews, providing a rich foundation for testing the pipeline.



Credits
Dataset: Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist, provided through Kaggle.
Tools and Technologies: AWS S3, Snowflake, Apache Airflow (via Astronomer), Python, SQL.
Usage
Run DAG: Trigger the ecommerce DAG from the Airflow UI for batch processing or scheduled runs.

Monitor Pipeline: Use Airflow’s built-in monitoring tools to track task progress, monitor dependencies, and troubleshoot any issues.

Extend Features: This pipeline can be extended with minimal effort to add logging, monitoring, and email notifications. Additionally, it can be enhanced to handle more complex data governance scenarios.



Future Enhancements
This pipeline is designed to be flexible and extendable, with a number of enhancements possible:

Additional AWS Tools: Adding services like AWS Lambda, SNS, WorkMail, SES, and SQS can automate notifications for DAG failures, file arrivals in S3, and more. Given more time and resources, these features could easily be integrated.

Enhanced Data Cleaning and Standardization: Currently, the dataset is clean and suited for this proof-of-concept. For larger, more complex datasets, features like enforcing UTF-8 encoding, data standardization, and enhanced data cleaning could be added. These can be implemented within minutes, as needed.

Advanced Folder Structures and Cold Storage: Batch processing schedules can be improved for daily, weekly, or monthly tasks, while S3 Glacier can be incorporated for cold storage, aligning with long-term data retention policies.

Data Lineage and Governance: Adding logging and metadata tracking for data lineage would provide even greater transparency and governance. This could be integrated with AWS Glue or Snowflake's built-in capabilities.

Scalable Reporting Dashboards: Although dashboards aren’t included in this setup, tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Looker could be easily integrated to provide live or periodic refresh capabilities, depending on reporting needs.




Disclaimer
This pipeline was developed in just two days, focused on building a fully functional and scalable data engineering solution using best-in-class cloud technologies. The Kaggle dataset, while small, served as a practical test case to showcase core pipeline functionality.

Given the short timeline and a single dataset, I chose to prioritize functionality and avoid overcomplicating the architecture with advanced tools like AWS Lambda, SNS, or SES. However, rest assured, these can be added in a matter of minutes.

The security setup is robust, with AWS IAM handling access control and Snowflake's RBAC ensuring proper governance. This pipeline is designed for scalability, security, and real-world business use, making it well-suited for larger, more complex datasets with minimal modifications.

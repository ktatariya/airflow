The architecture says AWS, Snowflake.

But since I do not have access to those environment as it is for showcasing.

This repo is more about showcasing a architecture skeleton that can be build with combination of Datalake (s3 in this case), Datawarehouse (Snowflake), Airflow, and then reporting in Tableau or any other Dashboarding tool out there.
